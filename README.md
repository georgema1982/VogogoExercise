VogogoExercise
==============

As part of Vogogo development exercise, implement the code for a checkout system that handles pricing  schemes such as “apples cost 50 cents each; three apples cost $1.30”.


The Goal
========

Write a console program that takes as input an unordered list of singular items from a shopping cart and “checks them out”, printing  an itemized receipt and a total price.

The receipt will follow Superstore's sytle, ie. in the case of "Buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y cents.", the item will be displayed as ``n/$y``. For example, "3 of them cost $4.97" will be displayed as ``3/$4.97``


Requirements
============

Please make sure that Python 2.7 has been installed. Virtualenv is recommended.

Installation
============

In any local directory, enter the following commands:

	$ git clone https://github.com/georgema1982/VogogoExercise.git
	$ cd VogogoExercise
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
	$ python manage.py syncdb
	$ python manage.py migrate

Optionally, you can run the unit tests inside the repository folder with the following command:

    $ python manage.py test


Usage
=====

There are two parts in this program. One part is the Admin part which is a web application where you can add items and their pricing rules. The other part is the console that takes as input an unordered list of singular items from a shopping cart and “checks them out”, printing  an itemized receipt and a total price.


Admin
-----

To start the Admin, run the following command in the repository folder:

	$ python manage.py runserver

Then go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and login with the credential you created during installation.

After login, go to Checkout > Items to add/edit/delete items and their pricing rules.

> Please note that each item must have an active base price, which is the price for an individual item.


Console Program
---------------

After items and the pricing rules are added, run the following command in the repository folder:

	$ python manage.py do_checkout code1 [code2 code3 ...]

> Codes should correspond to the item codes defined in the Admin. Nonexistent codes will cause the console program to fail. Codes should be separated by one space.

If everything goes well, you should see something like:

	1305    Apple
	  20 @ 5/$1.80                                7.20
	  3 @ 3/$1.20                                 1.20
	  1 @ $0.50 ea                                0.50
	1401    Orange
	  12 @ 3/$1.40                                5.60
	  2 @ $0.80 ea                                1.60
	4011    Banana
	  2 @ $0.40 ea                                0.80

	TOTAL                                        16.90
